# Data-Science
This repository is the parent repository where all the different tasks in the Data science are merged. 
Different tasks in Data science are shown in different repositories.

1) [Statistical concepts:](https://github.com/Kanchan-Adabala/Statistics-Multivariate-Methods) The projects on statistical inferences are covered in this repository.
2) [ML Projects:](https://github.com/Kanchan-Adabala/ML-Projects) All the projects on different Machine learning models are covered in this repository.
3) [Data-preprocessing:]() The data cleaning and processing projects are covered in this repository.

All the work done in R is showcased in [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Kanchan_Adabala).
Projects in Rpubs:
1) GLM on Faithful dataset: A simple linear regression model is built to predict intervals based on the previous eruption duration. This mainly illustrates the statistical inferences of the GLM model and analytical methods for deriving the coefficients. Also, optimisation is done to find the best value of slope if the intercept and standard deviation were provided.
2) Olympics Data investigation: How the number of medals a country wins can be predicted from national population and GDP, and how consistent these relationships are, using the glm function in R is investigated
